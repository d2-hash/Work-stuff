# Work-stuff
A project I was asked to do to generate a visual representation of real job data to assist in picking a new ware house location.  I was asked to keep it basic so I made a basic heat map to show the concentration of jobs, and then a separate map to isolate actual jobs versus ones that didn't develop.
